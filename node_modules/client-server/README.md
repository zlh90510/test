# Front End Coding Challenge
This is a project that I got from an interview. It is a command line app that can calculate the max response time, min response time, and average response time for requesting a list of urls for certain repetition.

## Getting Started
### Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```
### Start the server
```
npm start
```
### Start the client
You need a new window for this operation
```
npm build
```

## All the specific requirements are in the spec folder
